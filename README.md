# music-byte
On Spotify, finding playlists by other users is difficult unless you specifically search for a particular user's playlist or account. Music BYTE allows you to easily discover various public playlists and connect with other users with similar music tastes as you by recommending content based on your liked songs and artists. Unlike Spotify's recommendation page, which recommend playlists and radio content created by Spotify, Music BTYE mainly recommends public playlists created by other users.
