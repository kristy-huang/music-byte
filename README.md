Finding playlists by other users on Spotify is difficult unless you specifically search for a particular user's playlist or account. Music BYTE allows you to easily discover various public playlists and branch out to different types of music by recommending content based on your top songs, artists, and genres from your Spotify profile. Unlike Spotify's recommendation page, which recommend playlists and radio content created by Spotify itself, Music BTYE mainly recommends public playlists created by other users.
